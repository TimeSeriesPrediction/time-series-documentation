This repository holds all software documentation from a software engineering perspective for the Time Series Predicition project. The documents available are the following:

## System Requirements Specification

A System Requirements Specification (SRS) (also known as a Software Requirements Specification) is a document or set of documentation that describes the features and behavior of a system or software application. It includes a variety of elements (see below) that attempts to define the intended functionality required by the customer to satisfy their different users. In addition to specifying how the system should behave, the specification also defines at a high-level the main business processes that will be supported, what simplifying assumptions have been made and what key performance parameters will need to be met by the system.

## User Manual
